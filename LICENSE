 ThinkPublic License (TPL)
© 2025 Thendsoft (www.thendsoft.su)

Preamble
This license establishes the terms under which you may use, modify, and distribute software and other works licensed under the ThinkPublic License (the "Work"). The intent of this license is to promote open collaboration and sharing while protecting the integrity and recognition of original projects.

By exercising any rights to the Work, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of this license.

1. Definitions
"License" refers to this ThinkPublic License document.

"Work" refers to any software, documentation, or other material which is licensed under this License.

"You" refers to an individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

"Source Code" means the preferred form of the Work for making modifications.

"Derivative Work" means any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work, including modifications, additions, translations, or adaptations.

"Distribute" means to make available to the public by any means, including publication, transmission, and sharing.

"Original Work" refers to a specific Work distributed by its Licensor under this License, which is designated as the original by the copyright holder.

"Significant Changes" means modifications that fundamentally alter the Work's core functionality, architecture, or purpose, such that it is not merely a functional substitute for the Original Work.

2. Scope and Permissions
Subject to the terms of this License, you are granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free permission to:

Use the Work privately.

Study and modify the Work.

Distribute exact, verbatim copies of the Work.

Distribute your Derivative Works.

3. Copyleft Condition
If you Distribute a Derivative Work, you must license the entire Derivative Work, as a whole, under this License. This means any work that contains any portion of the Work must itself be licensed under the terms of the ThinkPublic License.

4. Restrictions and Conditions
Your exercise of the permissions under Section 2 is conditioned upon your compliance with the following restrictions.

a. Anti-Plagiarism Clause
You may not Distribute a Derivative Work that is substantially similar to an Original Work without Significant Changes and is presented as a new, distinct project. This is intended to prevent direct plagiarism and misappropriation of the original creator's effort. Substantial similarity is determined by the overall structure, design, features, and purpose of the resulting product.

b. Non-Commercial Clause for Collective Works
If your Work is a Derivative Work that incorporates code from another Work licensed under the ThinkPublic License (i.e., it is not your Original Work), then the entire resulting Work must be licensed and made available on a non-commercial basis. You may not charge a fee for the Work itself, though you may charge for distribution, support, or warranty protection.

This non-commercial condition does not apply if the Work you are Distributing is your Original Work that you have written from the ground up and have chosen to license under the ThinkPublic License.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO DISTRIBUTES THE WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK.

6. Termination
Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms. However, parties who have received Derivative Works from you will retain their licenses, provided they remain in full compliance.

7. General Provisions
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the Work.
